API Notes: BusinessChat framework
=================================

There appears to be no public API documentation for this framework
on Apple's developer website.

These bindings are accessed through the ``BusinessChat`` package (that is, ``import BusinessChat``).

.. note::

   This framework is only available on macOS 10.13.4 and later.


API Notes
---------

The entire API can be used from Python, but there are non-technical restrictions
on who can use the framework.
